# Contributing to My Project

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here are some guidelines for contributing to this project.

## Coding Standards

Please ensure your code adheres to the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html).

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement.
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the `main` branch.

It's very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch. This allows me to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Pull Request Review

All pull requests need to be reviewed and approved before they can be merged into the `main` branch.
